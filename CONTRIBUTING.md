# Contributing to NodeChat

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

With a project like this there is always room for improvement. You can view the [current issues here](https://github.com/pietertolsma/NodeChat/issues), or you can add your own features!

## Coding conventions
  
  To keep our code style consistent, we ask you to follow the following conventions:
  
  - We indent using single tabs.
  - We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters `([1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3])`, around operators `(x += 1`, `not x+=1)`, and around hash arrows.
  - We put spaces before and after method parameters like so: `if (true) { .. then this}`.

## Submitting changes

If you are ready to send a pull request, you should just go for it! Please make your commit messages as clear as possible. Also make sure you add one feature per commit. Your request will be reviewed as soon as possible!

Thanks!

Pieter Tolsma
